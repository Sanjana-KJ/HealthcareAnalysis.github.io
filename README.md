About the Project
This project focuses on predicting emergency room (ER) overcrowding using hospital data such as patient admissions, wait times, doctor availability, and equipment usage. It also includes external factors like holidays, flu outbreaks, and weather. By storing and analyzing this data using MySQL, Python, and Power BI, the project aims to identify peak times, forecast patient volume, and improve ER efficiency. The insights help hospitals make informed decisions about staffing, resource planning, and patient care management.


Project Description
This project aims to analyze and forecast patient traffic in hospital emergency rooms. By combining internal hospital data‚Äîsuch as patient admissions, wait times, triage levels,with external factors like weather, holidays, and flu outbreaks, the project helps identify patterns and predict peak overcrowding periods. Using tools like MySQL for data storage, Python for analysis and machine learning, and Power BI for visualization for easy understand manner.


Tools Used:
Excel ‚Äì Cleaning and formatting raw hospital data
Python (pandas) ‚Äì Handling missing values, converting timestamps, preparing features
MySQL ‚Äì Storing structured data in relational tables.
Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) ‚Äì Analyzing patterns in ER visits, wait times, weather,Date
Power BI ‚Äì Building dashboards for HealthCare Analysis
MySQL Connector for Power BI ‚Äì Live data integration from the database and presenting final recommendations with visuals
